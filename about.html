		<p class="subtext editable">Listener-specific head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) improve the perceived quality of virtual sound compared to using non-individualized HRTFs, but using them is not always feasible. The NEMO initiative proposes an alternative that could lead to a similar immersive experience. This alternative relies on the adaptation capabilities of listeners on learning to use a new set of HRTFs as if it was their own. We believe that the extensive use of a single set of non-individualized HRTFs has beneficial effects compared to being exposed to several of them. Therefore, we believe that the immersive audio community should agree on an HRTF recommendation to be used as default across platforms and applications.</p>
		<h1 class="editable"><strong> </strong></h1>
		<p class="subtext editable">The NEMO HRTF selection needs to be agreed among researchers, companies, developers and users. This can only be achieved with feedback from interested parties. We have started now collecting requirements that such an HRTF should fulfill. We encourage everyone interested to contribute with their ideas. We will collect all of them into a list of requirements to propose a NEMO HRTF that fulfills as many of them as possible. </p>
